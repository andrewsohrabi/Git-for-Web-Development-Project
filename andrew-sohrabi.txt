Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        block elements start on new line and take up full width available <div> </div>
        inline does not start on new line and only takes up necessary width <span> </span>
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
        the element's computed position is fixed relative to its parent, not the body itself
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
        body {
            display: inline-block | inline; 
        }
        
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        display block by default: <div>,<h1>, <section>
        display inline by default: <span>, <a>, <img>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        The CSS box model wraps around every HTML element: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. 
        We make the elements respect the width we have given them by explictly defining the width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height, and max-height properties.
